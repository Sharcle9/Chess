## Chess Simulator

This Java program is a simulation of the game of chess.

This is a school project for CS213 Software Methodolody at Rutgers University in Spring 2019.

## Instructions
The board will be printed to the terminal when you run Chess.java. Each chess piece has the format "COLOR+PIECE" (e.g. a black queen is "bQ"). An empty space is either represented by the string "  " or "##" depending on the color of the tile.

The game of chess can be played in console via user input (e.g. "a2 a3" to move the pawn from A2 to A3). If the input string is invalid, you'll be asked to input again. The game will automatically determine "check" & "checkmate" state each move, and disable moves that does not break the check status.
